<h1 align=center>Solving the 3 body gravitational problem using ANN</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  This projects objection is to build and train an artificial neural network to solve the famous 3 body gravitational problem. Due to the chaotic nature of the 3 body problem no close form solution exists to the problem. With the power of computers came aproximate solutions using methods such as the Runge-Kutta methods for solving systems of ODEs, now with the raise of neural networks we again make advancements in solving the 3 body problem.
